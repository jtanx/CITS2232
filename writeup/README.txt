To run this Django Unchained web application:

===================================

1. cd to the application/django directory

2. Call "python manage.py syncdb"
2.1 Say "no" to the question it asks you about super-users

3. Call "python manage.py loaddata all.json"

4. Call "python manage.py runserver

5. When that loads, open a web browser and go to "http://localhost:8000"

Go nuts!
You can Login with testadmin/testadmin or testuser/testuser, representing the two different types of users, or Register your own end user.
