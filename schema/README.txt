At the moment one question I have regarding our current schema is: can we have multiple contacts for each club?
ie, a President, a Secretary, a Treasurer etc?
at the moment our model can't support this, and it's probably easier to forget about it.
Making this happen will mean a new table I guess.
What do you guys think? I think we should probably forget about it.
